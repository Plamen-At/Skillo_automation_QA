//Write a program which calculates if a triangle can be built by 3 given angles. The angles are taken from the user input.
//There are two possible outputs – if the triangle can’t be built based on the angle values or the triangle can be built based on the angle values.
//If the triangle is possible the output should contain also the type of the triangle – acute (остроъгълен), right-angled (правоъгълен),
//obtuse (тъпоъгълен), equilateral (равностранен), isosceles (равнобедрен), multifaceted (разностранен).
