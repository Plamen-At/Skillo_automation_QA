//Define an interface named Shape that includes two methods: getAreaand getPerimeter, both returning a Double.
//Next, create two classes: Circle and Rectangle, that implement the Shape interface.
//In the Circle class, implement the getAreaand getPerimetermethods using the formulae for a circle's area and perimeter (Area = π * radius², Perimeter = 2 * π * radius).
//In the Rectangle class, implement these methods using the formulae for a rectangle's area and perimeter (Area = length * width, Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)).
//Finally, create a main class to instantiate a Circle and a Rectangle, then print out their area and perimeter. Predict the results before running the code.
